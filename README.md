# How to use it?

I would like use it as a tool for some intimate friends.

For example

1.  I create a count named: zyoohv
2.  Than i finish my profile
3.  The system confirm my profile
4.  Set my setting, for example let people can search me
5.  Add friends

Now, Every time i change my information, such as my telephone number, all my friends will change it by system. Of course i can get all my friends' information.

If you use smart phone, you can also import all your friends' phone number, qq number and so on.

# Difficult

2.  How to let user like to update their new information?

3.  Security problem.
